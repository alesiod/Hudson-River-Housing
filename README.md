This project looks at Hudson River Housing's 2023 HMIS data. Initial exploratory analysis was done in the HRH.rmd file, but all relevant analysis can be found in HRH-Report.rmd, which produces a PDF report. This file uses packages tidyverse and kableExtra. It contains three sections: data visualization, linear regression models, and analysis of missing data values. While the report uses 2023 data, the same code could likely be used for data in the same format from other years/spans of time by replacing the csv file "2023HRH.csv" with the relevant new data. The "2023HRH.csv" was acquired by exporting the rows that corresponded to the variable names and individual observations (excluding the beginning header and ending summary tables) from an Excel document generated from HMIS.
